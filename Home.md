## Notes

All of the course notes can be found [here](https://github.com/mrseidel-classes/ICS4U/tree/master/examples).  If you find other notes that you believe would prove useful for a particular item, please deposit a link to the IN drive folder and tag it as a suggestion in some way.

## Editor(s) and Installed Software
* Processing 3.3.5 would be useful for **Processing 3**
* Unity 2018 would be useful for **Unity**
* Code::Blocks would be useful for **C++**
* Visual Studio could be useful for **C++, C#, Xamarin,** or **Python**
* Notepad++ would be useful for **Lua, Love2D, Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, etc. (almost any language)**
* NetBeans would be useful for **Java**
* Eclipse would be useful for **Java**
* PyCharm or Python 3.7 GUI would be useful for **Python 3**
  * For anyone that needs to install packages yourself, you have two options:
    * You can use [repl.it](https://repl.it) to complete your work.  If you need a GUI, you can use the [PySimpleGUI](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbook/) package to get a GUI going.  _For those previously using PySimpleGUIWeb, there has been an [update by the developer](https://github.com/johnfraserss/ICS4U/issues/21) noting that you can use PySimpleGUI on repl.it (assuming you start a TKinter project)._
    * Otherwise, you can download [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) to install to a USB key.
