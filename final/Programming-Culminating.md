## Task(s)

This portfolio-based culminating activity is worth **15%** of the **30%** final mark.  

* Solve the problem you decided upon at the beginning of the semester for your [Main Program](./Main-Program).
* In a _**meaningful and effective**_ way, ensure that you include all of the concepts learned throughout the course:
  * Documentation
  * Objects
  * Files
  * Extending Objects
  * Sorting and Searching
  * _**Forcing a concept into the program will not count as using the concept meaningfully or effectively.**_

See success criteria below for a reminder of the concepts learning throughout the course, and what you will be evaluated on.

## What to Hand in?
Hand in the following to the IN drive before the time shown in the due dates section below:
* All of your programming files for this project, and
* All updated documentation including:
  * Flowchart,
  * User Manual, and
  * UML diagrams

## Due Dates and Submission Details

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.

## Goals and Success Criteria

The specific goal(s) for this [_Programming Concepts_](./images/ICS4U.jpg) culminating task include:
  * Use proper code maintenance techniques. &#x1F4D8;

  * Use complex data types. &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;
  * Design, write and analyze complex algorithms and subprograms. &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;


| Goal            | Success Criteria | Level |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ----- |
| &#x1F4D8; | I can work independently, using support documentation, to resolve syntax issues during software development. | |
| &#x1F4D8; | I can create fully documented program code according to industry standards. | |
| &#x1F4D8; | I can create clear and maintainable external user documentation. | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can decompose a problem into modules, classes, or abstract data types using an object-oriented design methodology (using classes, methods, etc. using flowcharts, UML, etc.) | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can apply data encapsulation in a program design (using classes, methods, etc. in a computer program). | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can apply the principle of reusability in program design (i.e. in modules, methods, classes, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.) | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can convert between different types of variables (i.e. string-to-integer, integer-to-character, etc.). | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can use one-dimensional arrays of compound data types (i.e. objects, structures, etc.). | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can read from, and write to, an external file (i.e. database, API, text file, binary file, etc.). | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;<br/>&#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can create two **sorting** algorithms (as per Sorting & Searching assignment) to sort data in an array/list (these should be able to be used if they were uncommented). | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;<br/>&#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can create a **linear search** algorithm to find data in an array (this should be able to be used if they were uncommented). | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;<br/>&#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can create a **binary search** algorithm to find data in an array (this should be able to be used if they were uncommented). | |
