# Task(s)

Choose a theoretical computer science topic from the list below and create a report in any style, using any method of delivery (excluding a word processing document), that focuses on:

* What the theoretical computer science topic is
* The impacts (+ and -) of the theoretical computer science on societies and cultures around the world.
* Any ethical issues that could propagate from the development or implementation of this technology.
* Propose strategies to encourage ethical practices related to the ethical issues you discussed above.
* Research and describe careers associated with computer studies and the chosen theoretical computer science research field.
* Research and describe post-secondary education required to prepare for a career in this particular theoretical computer science research field.

**Your sources _must_ include at least two "industry publication".** These include academic journals, defended thesis papers, peer-review articles, etc.

Be prepared to discuss your work and present-to-the-teacher the information that you have found. Be prepared to answer difficult questions and understand all of the acronyms in your presentation.

### Theoretical Computer Science options
_Note_: There will be a limit on topic selection so that there is at **most** 3 presentations per topic.  A topic selection sheet will be available at least 2 weeks prior to the start of presentations.
  * Attribute Grammar
  * Automata Theory
  * Complexity Theory
  * Computability Theory
  * Computational Biology
  * Computational Geometry
  * Computational Number Theory
  * Concurrency Theory
  * Lattices and Basis Reduction
  * Symbolic Computation
