## Task(s)

Continuing on your [Main Program](./Main-Program) voyage, it is your task to:
* Research and learn more about extending objects.
  * Notes [here](./Extending-Objects-Notes)  
  * Examples [here][Ex].
  * You can also check the following YouTube videos as a start
    * Inheritance: [Java][1], [JavaScript][2], [Python][3]
    * Interfaces: [Java][4]
    * Abstract Classes: [Java][5], [Python][7]
* You are required to include **one** of the following concepts into your [Main Program](./Main-Program):
  * _Inheritance_, _Interfaces_, or _Abstract Classes_.
* Document your new classes, functions, and methods.
  * Some languages have special inheritance-style documentation (e.g. Java has a ```{@inheritDoc}``` tag available)
* Update your documentation as follows:
  * User manual should be **almost** complete by the end of this assignment.
  * Your flowchart should now be a [**detailed flowchart**][Flow].
  * Your [**UML class diagram**](./UML-Notes) should now include _Extending Objects_ information and any connections as appropriate.  This diagram should now include any instance variables and methods on a per-class basis.
  * Update your [**UML use case diagram**](./UML-Notes) to have more detail inside of the "system" portion (if applicable).

## Due Dates and Submission Details

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal(s)](./images/ICS4U.jpg) for this include _Programming Concepts_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * We are learning to use proper code maintenance techniques. &#x1F4D8;
  * We are learning to design and apply modular programming concepts. &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;

| Learning Goal | Success Criteria | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| &#x1F4D8; | I can work independently, using support documentation, to resolve syntax issues during software development. | |
| &#x1F4D8; | I can create fully documented program code according to industry standards. | |
| &#x1F4D8; | I can create clear and maintainable external user documentation. | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can decompose a problem into modules, classes, or abstract data types using an object-oriented design methodology (using classes, methods, etc. using flowcharts, UML, etc.) | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can apply data encapsulation in a program design (using classes, methods, etc. in a computer program). | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can apply the principle of reusability in program design (i.e. in modules, methods, classes, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.) | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can modify modular program code to enhance the functionality of a program. | |
