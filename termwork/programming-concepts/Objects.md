## Task(s)

Using the language that you chose to use for the year, it is your task to: 
* Research and learn more about classes and objects (not the _struct_ datatype for anyone doing C++).  Some examples are [here](https://github.com/johnfraserss/ICS4U/tree/master/examples/objects) to get you started.
* Create the following initial documents/diagrams:
  * Template of a user manual on how to use your program (no details expected, just sections and section headers).
  * [**high-level** flowchart](https://github.com/mrseidel-classes/ICS3U/wiki/Flowcharting-Notes) (think 10-15 symbol max),
  * [**high-level** UML use case diagram](./UML-Notes),
  * [**high-level** UML class diagram](./UML-Notes), and
  * **design** (some example screenshots)
* The documents/diagrams are just an initial plan, things can (and probably will) change as the semester goes on.
* Once you have completed the diagrams and researching objects/classes, start implementing objects and classes into your [Main Program](./Main-Program).
* Include documentation for your classes and any methods/functions you create.

Your documents will be checked as the semester goes along to ensure that you have been updating them.  They will be checked during the Extending Objects and Sorting and Searching assignments, as well as in your culminating.  You are being assessed on the clarity and maintainability of these documents.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal(s)](./images/ICS4U.jpg) for this include _Programming Concepts_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * We are learning to use proper code maintenance techniques. &#x1F4D8;
  * We are learning to design and apply modular programming concepts. &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;

| Learning Goal | Success Criteria | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| &#x1F4D8; | I can work independently, using support documentation, to resolve syntax issues during software development. | |
| &#x1F4D8; | I can create fully documented program code according to industry standards. | |
| &#x1F4D8; | I can create clear and maintainable external user documentation. | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can decompose a problem into modules, classes, or abstract data types using an object-oriented design methodology (using classes, methods, etc. using flowcharts, UML, etc.) | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can apply data encapsulation in a program design (using classes, methods, etc. in a computer program). | |
