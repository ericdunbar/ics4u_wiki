## Task(s)

Continuing on your [Main Program](./Main-Program) voyage, it is your task to:
* Research and learn more about sorting (O(n^2) algorithms) and searching (linear and binary).  If you need to refer back to them, the [sorting notes](https://prezi.com/_c5eer8nslnm/?token=88ece7eaa67f60ab5460103cce9b5d825cbfc1fbc6078a6e7d24ed005116eb51&utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share) and [searching notes](https://prezi.com/kpgyneipmt8d/?token=ae5e2b5183917c2f7255596164f5d487a9a8a9a55d769fa66405d57c9886e5d5&utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share) are available.
* Complete the _Sorting_, _Searching_, and _General_ tasks below.

### Sorting Task(s):
* Create your own ```bubble sort``` and ```insertion sort``` algorithms and implement them into your [Main Program](./Main-Program).  These sorts should be sorting through your [Extending Objects](./Extending-Objects) array/list.
* If you don't have a large amount of data, you are to create a separate file for this project that incorporates 50MB or more data (related to your program).
* Sort the data and display it in some way.
* Complete a computational complexity analysis of each of your own sorting algorithms and also compare it to the built-in ```.sort()``` function (figure out which one runs faster, why, when, etc.)
* Once this task is complete, comment out your own sorts and use the built-in ```.sort()``` going forward.

### Searching Task(s):
* Create your own ```linear search``` and ```binary search``` algorithms and implement them into your [Main Program](./Main-Program).  These sorts should be sorting through your [Extending Objects](./Extending-Objects) array/list.
* Complete a computational complexity analysis of each of the searching algorithms.  One part of this analysis should include a comparison between using ```linear search``` and using ```binary search``` + ```.sort()```.

### General Task(s):
* Update your internal documentation, flowchart, and UML diagrams to include the sorting/searching work. (This won't be checked now, but will be when the [Programming Culminating](./Programming-Culminating) is due, so you might as well do it now while you remember.
* Update your external documentation to include a lot more detail in each of the headings.

Be prepared to speak about the computational complexity analyses, and have **empirical data** to back up your statements.
