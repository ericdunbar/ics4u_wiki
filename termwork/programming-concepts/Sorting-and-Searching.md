## Task(s)

Continuing on your [Main Program](./Main-Program) voyage, it is your task to:
* Research and learn more about sorting (bubble and selection) and searching (linear and binary).  
* To assist you in this endeavour, you can read through the following webpages:
  * Bubble **Sort**: [Tutorial](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/sorting/bubble-sort/tutorial/) -- [Visualizer (set size = 6, layout = array, click run)](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/sorting/bubble-sort/visualize/)
  * Selection **Sort**: [Tutorial](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/sorting/selection-sort/tutorial/) -- [Visualizer (set size = 6, layout = array, click run)](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/sorting/selection-sort/visualize/)
  * Linear **Search**: [Tutorial](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/searching/linear-search/tutorial/)
  * Binary **Search**: [Tutorial](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/searching/binary-search/tutorial/)
  * Computation Complexity: [Paper (5 pages)](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/180/handouts/complexity.pdf) -- [Bubble Sort](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/180/lectures/W10/lec3/BubbleSortCompl.html) -- [Selection Sort](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/180/lectures/W10/lec1/SelectionSortCompl.html) 
* If you're interested, I also have Prezi presentations available for both [sorting](https://prezi.com/_c5eer8nslnm/?token=88ece7eaa67f60ab5460103cce9b5d825cbfc1fbc6078a6e7d24ed005116eb51&utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share) and [searching](https://prezi.com/kpgyneipmt8d/?token=ae5e2b5183917c2f7255596164f5d487a9a8a9a55d769fa66405d57c9886e5d5&utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share).
* Complete the _Sorting_, _Searching_, and _General_ tasks below.

### Sorting Task(s):
* Create your own ```bubble sort``` and ```selection sort``` algorithms and implement them into your [Main Program](./Main-Program).  These sorts should be sorting through your [Files](./Files) array/list.
* If you don't have a large amount of data, you are to create a separate file for this project that incorporates 5MB of data or more (related to your program).
* Sort the data and display it in some way.
* Complete a computational complexity analysis of each of your own sorting algorithms and also compare it to the built-in ```.sort()``` function (figure out which one runs faster, why, when, etc.)
* Once this task is complete, comment out your own sorts and use the built-in ```.sort()``` going forward.

### Searching Task(s):
* Create your own ```linear search``` and ```binary search``` algorithms and implement them into your [Main Program](./Main-Program).  These searches should be searching through the sorted [Files](./Files) array/list.
* Complete a computational complexity analysis of each of the searching algorithms.  One part of this analysis should include a comparison between using ```linear search``` and using ```binary search``` + ```.sort()```.

### General Task(s):
* Update your internal documentation, flowchart, and UML diagrams to include the sorting/searching work. (This won't be checked now, but will be when the [Programming Culminating](./Programming-Culminating) is due, so you might as well do it now while you remember.
* Update your external documentation to include a lot more detail in each of the headings.

Ensure that you have **empirical data** to back up your computational complexity analyses.

## Due Dates and Submission Details

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.

You can submit this via the IN drive, or via email.
